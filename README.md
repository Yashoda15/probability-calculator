# Probability Calculator

This Python project simulates drawing balls from a hat to estimate the probability of drawing specific combinations. It utilizes Monte Carlo simulations to provide statistical insights.

## Features

- Define a hat with any number and color of balls.
- Draw a specified number of balls randomly.
- Calculate the probability of drawing at least the expected number of each color.
- Run multiple experiments to estimate probabilities.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yashoda15/Probability-Calculator.git
cd Probability-Calculator

## Usage

-Run the program:

python probability_calculator.py


-Follow the prompts:

-Enter colors and counts of balls in the hat:

Enter ball color (or 'done' to finish): red
Enter number of red balls: 5
Enter ball color (or 'done' to finish): blue
Enter number of blue balls: 3
Enter ball color (or 'done' to finish): done


-Enter the number of balls to draw:

Number of balls to draw: 4


-Enter the expected number of each color:

Enter expected ball color (or 'done' to finish): red
Enter minimum number of red balls: 2
Enter expected ball color (or 'done' to finish): done


-Enter the number of experiments to run:

Number of experiments to run: 1000


-The program will output the estimated probability:

Estimated Probability: 0.5270
